 * <p>Example of the Strategy (also known as policy) design pattern.</p>
 * <p>
 *  <b>When to use it</b>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>You have many classes that only differ in behaviour, and so you can configure a class with one of many
 *      behaviours.</li>
 *      <li>You need difference variants of an algorithm</li>
 *      <li>A class defines many different behaviours and these appear as many conditional statements</li>
 *  </ul>
 * </p>
